I am currently a PhD student of SE at JiangNan University([JNU](https://www.jiangnan.edu.cn/)), under the supervision of Professor [Zhaohong Deng](http://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1013/1548.htm). Before that, I worked in Huawei Compiler & Promgramming Language Laboratory from July 2018 to July 2022.  I did my Master of EE at Nangjing University of Posts and Telecommunications([NUPT](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/)), supervised by Professor [Chen Liu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E9%99%88/4206045). My undergrad was at SouthWest University([SWU](http://www.swu.edu.cn/)). <br>
