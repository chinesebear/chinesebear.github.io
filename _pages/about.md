I am currently a PhD student of SE at JiangNan University([JNU](https://www.jiangnan.edu.cn/)), under the supervision of Professor [Zhaohong Deng](http://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1013/1548.htm). Before that, I worked in Huawei Compiler & Promgramming Language Laboratory from July 2018 to July 2022.  I did my Master of EE at Nangjing University of Posts and Telecommunications([NUPT](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/)), supervised by Professor [Chen Liu](https://dsfc.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52B282DCFE050007F01006EFE). My undergrad was at SouthWest University([SWU](http://www.swu.edu.cn/)). <br>
I am mainly working on fuzzy system, code generation and machine learning. I am also interested in programming language, domain specific language(DSL), compiler, transpiler, RTOS, AIoT and TinyML.<br>
